# memoryRun
This is a fun little game that I made which tests your short term memory, orientation, and attention. In other words, this is a cognitive game. 
How to play: 
The program gives you a set of the chosen quantity of numbers, each number represents a slot. 
You must memorize the numbers. Then when the program says: "Chose the right slot in... ", you get about 3 seconds tto try and remember the next number in the set, and click that slot on the screen. 
If you get the number correct, then your character passes through an underground tunnel, and he is safe, and you continue. Otherwise, you run into spikes, and your score resets. 

Enjoy!

Note: You can also play the game on the website, without having to download it: https://maxikichka.github.io/memoryRun/
